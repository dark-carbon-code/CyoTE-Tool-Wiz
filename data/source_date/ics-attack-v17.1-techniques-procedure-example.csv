G9001,Graphite,T0865,Spearphishing Attachment,"GRAPHITE is focused on energy and industrial organizations in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, particularly those involved in the military conflict in Ukraine. Since 2022, the group has conducted spear-phishing campaigns to steal credentials, often exploiting vulnerabilities like a no-click flaw in Microsoft Outlook.  The group initially relied on compromised Ubiquiti Edge Routers networks to distribute malware and maintain command-and-control (C2) operations. However, after a U.S.-led takedown of their botnet in early 2024, GRAPHITE shifted to using legitimate internet services, such as API endpoint testing platforms and GitHub, to stage their attacks.

S0603,Stuxnet,T0886,Remote Services,"[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) executes malicious SQL commands in the WinCC database server to propagate to remote systems. The malicious SQL commands include xp_cmdshell, sp_dumpdbilog, and sp_addextendedproc. (Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011)"
S0603,Stuxnet,T0888,Remote System Information Discovery,"[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.(Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011)

[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C. The PLC type can also be checked using the s7ag_read_szl API.(Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011)"
S0603,Stuxnet,T0847,Replication Through Removable Media,"[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) was able to self-replicate by being spread through removable drives. A willing insider or unknown third party, such as a contractor, may have brought the removable media into the target environment. (Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011) The earliest version of Stuxnet relied on physical installation, infecting target systems when an infected configuration file carried by a USB stick was opened. (Citation: Langer Stuxnet)"
S0603,Stuxnet,T0851,Rootkit,"One of [Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603)'s rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll. In order to continue existing undetected on the PLC it needs to account for at least the following situations: read requests for its own malicious code blocks, read requests for infected blocks (OB1, OB35, DP_RECV), and write requests that could overwrite Stuxnets own code. Stuxnet contains code to monitor and intercept these types of requests. The rootkit modifies these requests so that Stuxnets PLC code is not discovered or damaged. (Citation: Langer Stuxnet)"
S0603,Stuxnet,T0869,Standard Application Layer Protocol,"[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) uses a thread to monitor a data block DB890 of sequence A or B. This thread is constantly running and probing this block (every 5 minutes). On an infected PLC, if block DB890 is found and contains a special magic value (used by Stuxnet to identify his own block DB890), this blocks data can be read and written. This thread is likely used to optimize the way sequences A and B work, and modify their behavior when the Step7 editor is opened. (Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011)"
S0603,Stuxnet,T0863,User Execution,"[Stuxnet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603) infects DLL's associated with the WinCC Simatic manager which are responsible for opening project files. If a user opens an uninfected project file using a compromised manager, the file will be infected with Stuxnet code. If an infected project is opened with the Simatic manager, the modified data file will trigger a search for the `xyz.dll` file. If the `xyz.dll` file is not found in any of the specified locations, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed by the manager.
