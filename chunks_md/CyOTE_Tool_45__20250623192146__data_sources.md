## DS0001 - None

Computer software that provides low-level control for the hardware and device(s) of a host, such as BIOS or UEFI/EFI

### Component: None

Changes made to firmware, which may include its settings, configurations, or underlying data. This can encompass alterations to the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or other firmware components critical to system boot and functionality. Such modifications are often indicators of adversary activity, including malware persistence and system compromise. Examples: 

- Changes to Master Boot Record (MBR): Modifying the MBR to load malicious code during the boot process.
- Changes to Volume Boot Record (VBR): Altering the VBR to redirect boot processes to malicious locations.
- Firmware Configuration Changes: Modifying BIOS/UEFI settings such as disabling Secure Boot.
- Firmware Image Tampering: Updating firmware with a malicious or unauthorized image.
- Logs or Errors Indicating Firmware Changes: Logs showing unauthorized firmware updates or checksum mismatches.

This data component can be collected through the following measures:

- BIOS/UEFI Logs: Enable and monitor BIOS/UEFI logs to capture settings changes or firmware updates.
- Firmware Integrity Monitoring: Use tools or firmware security features to detect changes to firmware components.
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions: Many EDR platforms can detect abnormal firmware activity, such as changes to MBR/VBR or unauthorized firmware updates.
- File System Monitoring: Monitor changes to MBR/VBR-related files using tools like Sysmon or auditd.
    - Windows Example (Sysmon): Monitor Event ID 7 (Raw disk access).
    - Linux Example (auditd): `auditctl -w /dev/sda -p wa -k firmware_modification`
- Network Traffic Analysis: Capture firmware updates downloaded over the network, particularly from untrusted sources. Use network monitoring tools like Zeek or Wireshark to analyze firmware-related traffic.
- Secure Boot Logs: Collect and analyze Secure Boot logs for signs of tampering or unauthorized configurations. Example: Use PowerShell to retrieve Secure Boot settings on Windows: `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`
- Vendor-Specific Firmware Tools: Many hardware vendors provide tools for firmware integrity checks.Examples:
    - Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR).
    - Lenovo UEFI diagnostics.

These events can indicate legitimate housekeeping activities or malicious actions such as attackers attempting to cover their tracks. Monitoring file deletions helps organizations identify unauthorized or suspicious activities.

This data component can be collected through the following measures:

Windows

- Sysmon: Event ID 23: Logs file deletion events, including details such as file paths and responsible processes.
- Windows Event Log: Enable "Object Access" auditing to monitor file deletions.
- PowerShell: `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663} | Where-Object {$_.Message -like '*DELETE*'}`

Linux

- Auditd: Use audit rules to capture file deletion events: `auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink -S rename -S rmdir -k file_deletion`
- Query logs: `ausearch -k file_deletion`
- Inotify: Use inotifywait to monitor file deletions: `inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e delete`

macOS

- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor events like ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_UNLINK to capture file deletion activities.
- FSEvents: Track file deletion activities in real-time: `fs_usage | grep unlink`

SIEM Integration

- Forward file deletion logs to a SIEM for centralized monitoring and correlation with other events.


### Component: None

contextual information about a file, including attributes such as the file's name, size, type, content (e.g., signatures, headers, media), user/owner, permissions, timestamps, and other related properties. File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: 

- File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM on Windows.
- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.
- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.
- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.
- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.
- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.

This data component can be collected through the following measures:

Windows

- Sysinternals Tools: Use `AccessEnum` or `PSFile` to retrieve metadata about file access and permissions.
- Windows Event Logs: Enable object access auditing and monitor events like 4663 (Object Access) and 5140 (A network share object was accessed).
- PowerShell: Use Get-Item or Get-ChildItem cmdlets: `Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Path\To\Directory" -Recurse | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime, Attributes`

Linux

- File System Commands: Use `ls -l` or stat to retrieve file metadata: `stat /path/to/file`
- Auditd: Configure audit rules to log metadata access: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa -k file_metadata`
- Filesystem Integrity Tools: Tools like tripwire or AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) can monitor file metadata changes.

macOS

- FSEvents: Use FSEvents to track file metadata changes.
- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Capture metadata-related events via ESF APIs.
- Command-Line Tools: Use ls -l or xattr for file attributes: `ls -l@ /path/to/file`

SIEM Integration

- Forward file metadata logs from endpoint or network devices to a SIEM for centralized analysis.

### Component: None

Changes made to a file, including updates to its contents, metadata, access permissions, or attributes. These modifications may indicate legitimate activity (e.g., software updates) or unauthorized changes (e.g., tampering, ransomware, or adversarial modifications). Examples: 

- Content Modifications: Changes to the content of a configuration file, such as modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows.
- Permission Changes: Altering file permissions to allow broader access, such as changing a file from `644` to `777` on Linux or modifying NTFS permissions on Windows.
- Attribute Modifications: Changing a file's attributes to hidden, read-only, or system on Windows.
- Timestamp Manipulation: Adjusting a file's creation or modification timestamp using tools like `touch` in Linux or timestomping tools on Windows.
- Software or System File Changes: Modifying system files such as `boot.ini`, kernel modules, or application binaries.

This data component can be collected through the following measures:

Windows

- Event Logs: Enable file system auditing to monitor file modifications using Security Event ID 4670 (File System Audit) or Sysmon Event ID 2 (File creation time changed).
- PowerShell: Use Get-ItemProperty or Get-Acl cmdlets to monitor file properties: `Get-Item -Path "C:\path\to\file" | Select-Object Name, Attributes, LastWriteTime`

Linux

- File System Monitoring: Use tools like auditd with rules to monitor file modifications: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa -k file_modification`
- Inotify: Use inotifywait to watch for real-time changes to files or directories: `inotifywait -m /path/to/file`

macOS

- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor file modification events using ESF APIs.
- Audit Framework: Configure audit rules to track file changes.
- Command-Line Tools: Use fs_usage to monitor file activities: `fs_usage -w /path/to/file`

SIEM Tools

- Collect logs from endpoint agents (e.g., Sysmon, Auditd) and file servers to centralize file modification event data.
