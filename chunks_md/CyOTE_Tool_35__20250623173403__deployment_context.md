# ðŸš€ Deployment Context
- **TRL**: 4
- **Hosting env**: Tool runs as a command-line application on a userâ€™s local machine or testbed., Tool runs as a native graphical application on a local workstation (e.g., Windows .exe or macOS .app)., Tool is deployed as a VM image requiring a hypervisor such as VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V., Tool is deployed in a Docker or Podman container, either standalone or as part of a multi-container stack.
- **Interfaces**: Interaction via shell or terminal using typed commands for configuration or execution., Visual interface with forms, buttons, and input fields, accessible via desktop or web., Web-accessible UI offering dashboards, charts, or configuration pages., Form-driven input where users fill out fields like observables, filters, or configs., CLI interface that prompts user input step-by-step instead of batch execution.
- **Access methods**: Tool or service is accessed via a public or internal website URL., Tool is available as open-source or binary via GitHub., Tool is distributed as a downloadable package (e.g., EXE, MSI, DEB).
- **Input types**: Tabular indicators, logs, or IOCs in a spreadsheet-compatible format, Generic structured input for configurations, logs, or indicators, Network packet capture used for protocol analysis or anomaly detection, Narrative CTI or threat reports for parsing, summarizing, or entity extraction
- **Output types**: Structured CTI output used for intelligence sharing and correlation, Structured machine-readable output (e.g., alerts, configs, observables), Tabular data for analysis in tools like Excel, pandas, or SOC dashboards, Rich narrative output including results, analysis, figures, and recommendations
- **Import formats**: Structured CTI ingestion format used in threat intelligence systems (e.g., OpenCTI, MISP), Generic structured data input format used for configurations, enrichment, or model-based inputs, Spreadsheet-compatible format used for importing indicators, logs, or IOC lists, Packet capture file for ingesting raw network traffic for analysis
- **Export formats**: Structured Threat Intelligence format (OASIS) for sharing CTI with tools like OpenCTI, MISP, General-purpose structured format for config, logs, telemetry, or API response data, Tabular data format for structured logs, observables, indicators, or reports, Human-readable output for briefings, summaries, or deliverables, Raw log export or plain text data for analyst review, Packet capture export for replay or further network analysis
