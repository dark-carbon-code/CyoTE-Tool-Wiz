# CSF 2.0 Use Cases

## None (GV.OC)



## None (GV.RM)

Cybersecurity risk management activities and outcomes are included in enterprise risk management processes Strategic opportunities (i.e., positive risks) are characterized and are included in organizational cybersecurity risk discussions

## None (GV.RR)

Organizational leadership is responsible and accountable for cybersecurity risk and fosters a culture that is risk-aware, ethical, and continually improving

## None (GV.PO)



## None (GV.OV)

Results of organization-wide cybersecurity risk management activities and performance are used to inform, improve, and adjust the risk management strategy

## None (GV.SC)



## None (ID.AM)

Assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people) that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization's risk strategy

## None (ID.RA)

## None (DE.AE)

A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems is established and managed Potentially adverse events are analyzed to better understand associated activities Information is correlated from multiple sources The estimated impact and scope of adverse events are understood Incident alert thresholds are established Cyber threat intelligence and other contextual information are integrated into the analysis Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria

## None (RS.MA)

Responses to detected cybersecurity incidents are managed

## None (RS.AN)

Investigations are conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities

## None (RS.CO)

Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders as required by laws, regulations, or policies

## None (RS.MI)
