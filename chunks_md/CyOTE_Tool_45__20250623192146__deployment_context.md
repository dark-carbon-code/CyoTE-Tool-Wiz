# ðŸš€ Deployment Context

**TRL**: 1

**Hosting env**: Tool runs as a command-line application on a userâ€™s local machine or testbed.

**Interfaces**: Interaction via shell or terminal using typed commands for configuration or execution.

**Access methods**: Tool or service is accessed via a public or internal website URL.

**Input types**: Tabular indicators, logs, or IOCs in a spreadsheet-compatible format, Generic structured input for configurations, logs, or indicators, Network packet capture used for protocol analysis or anomaly detection, Narrative CTI or threat reports for parsing, summarizing, or entity extraction, Structured CTI ingestion format used by most threat intel platforms

**Output types**: Structured machine-readable output (e.g., alerts, configs, observables), Tabular data for analysis in tools like Excel, pandas, or SOC dashboards, Rich narrative output including results, analysis, figures, and recommendations, Plain text logs, debug info, or analyst comments, Network capture of real or simulated traffic for deep inspection or training

**Import formats**: Structured CTI ingestion format used in threat intelligence systems (e.g., OpenCTI, MISP), Generic structured data input format used for configurations, enrichment, or model-based inputs, Spreadsheet-compatible format used for importing indicators, logs, or IOC lists, Packet capture file for ingesting raw network traffic for analysis, Narrative reports or fact sheets used for NLP-based entity extraction or contextual ingestion, Unstructured logs or plain-text alerts

**Export formats**: Structured Threat Intelligence format (OASIS) for sharing CTI with tools like OpenCTI, MISP, General-purpose structured format for config, logs, telemetry, or API response data, Tabular data format for structured logs, observables, indicators, or reports, Human-readable output for briefings, summaries, or deliverables, Raw log export or plain text data for analyst review, Packet capture export for replay or further network analysis, Human-readable structured format for config files, policy export, or AI/ML pipelines
